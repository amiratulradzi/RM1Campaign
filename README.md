The JavaScript interaction that I have created for the 1-page website are
1. The validateForm function is called when the form is submitted.
2. The validateForm function checks various form fields for validation, such as ensuring required fields are not empty and validating the format of certain fields.
3. If any validation fails, the form submission is prevented, and error messages are displayed.
4. If the form passes validation, a notification is displayed, indicating that the form has been successfully submitted.
